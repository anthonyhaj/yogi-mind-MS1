## Design

### Color
I designed my website with simple coloring and with navigation. The color scheme calming and cozy with a shade of pink and a mixture of greys and whites. I chose my colors by seeing different color schemes and contrasts on brandcolor.net. My design is clean and minimalistic with a focus of simplicity and ease of us. Below I have included the color scheme using Adobe Color.

Using Google Fonts, The first font for the headings and logo was League Spartan and the secondly for texts and paaragraphs I used Roboto which matched very well together giving a warm look.
